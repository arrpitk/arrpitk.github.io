The "Market Basket Analysis and Predictive Maintenance" project combines advanced data analytics and machine learning to both uncover purchasing patterns and predict machine maintenance needs. Using association rule algorithms, it aids in optimizing marketing and inventory management, while predictive models trained on machine data and logs aim to reduce costs and downtime by preemptively identifying potential failures.
